:construction: :construction: :construction: The repo is still under construction. Feel free to provide updated blochchain resource on [PR](https://github.com/avence12/awesome-blockchain/pulls). 

### If you want to know what blockchain is ..
> Blockchain may be the next **BIG THING** as the Fourth Wave. Recommend you to check out [blockchain concepts](#concept). Knowing the history, idea, and fundamental technologies. Technically speaking, blockchain is a distributed database. The records are stored in containers called blocks. The blocks are linked to each other and are secured using cryptography.
